# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-prediction

Booking cancellations have a significant impact on the hotel industry. The percentage of cancellations is reaching almost 40%. If a person booked a room, and he/she canceled before the day of arrival it causes commercial loss to the management because to arrange the room for customers there will be some necessary work like cleaning that should be done. The main reasons for the unavailability of selected rooms,customer-centric reasons, parking spaces, etc. The objective of our project is to analyze and predict booking cancellations. The dataset which was used consists of the data of two hotels, by testing the attributes of the hotels we will find the various impacts that may be used to predict which bookings are likely to cancel. By using this data we will analyze and visualize the data which provides the infer about the performance of the two hotels by comparing their data. We have used Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost Classifier, and GradientBoost Classifier. From the F1 Score, we have found out that the Random Forest Model has outperformed all other algorithms. We have identified that lead_time,deposit_type, and ADR are the most important features that affect the booking cancellation.
